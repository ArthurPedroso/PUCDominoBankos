# 2D Domino Game with OpenGL

This project is a 2D domino game built using OpenGL. The game engine was constructed from scratch following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, as it was a requirement for the Programming Laboratory class at PUCSP. The primary focus of this project was to write as much code as possible in C.

## Features

- **OpenGL Graphics:** Utilizes OpenGL for rendering the 2D domino game.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:** Organized codebase following MVC design principles.
- **C Language:** Majority of the codebase is written in C for academic purposes.
